# Test Plan — Online Vehicle Reservation System

**Module:** CIS6003 Advanced Programming | **Task:** C (Testing, 20 marks)

## 1. Scope

This plan covers testing of the backend REST API (`backend/`), its integration
with MySQL, and the end-to-end behaviour exercised through the frontend client.
It excludes purely cosmetic/CSS testing and third-party libraries (Spring
Framework, Bootstrap) that are assumed correct.

## 2. Objectives

1. Verify every functionality in the assignment brief works correctly:
   login, register a reservation, search/display a reservation, calculate and
   print a bill, the help section, and logout ("exit system").
2. Verify the business rules that are *not* stated explicitly in the brief but
   are essential to a credible reservation system: no double-booking, correct
   pricing under three different strategies, and correct role-based access.
3. Verify the system's persistence layer (MySQL, including the trigger,
   stored procedure and views) behaves correctly, not just the Java code in
   isolation.
4. Produce durable, automated evidence (a JUnit suite that can be re-run by any
   grader with one command) rather than only a manual click-through record.

## 3. Test-Driven Development (TDD) — rationale and how it was applied

TDD was applied specifically to the **pricing/billing logic**
(`pattern.strategy` package), because it is the most business-critical, purely
computational part of the system — a bug here directly produces a wrong bill,
which is the single output a real customer scrutinises most closely.

**Why this component and not the whole codebase:** TDD pays off most where (a)
requirements can be expressed as concrete input→output examples before any code
exists, and (b) the logic is easy to isolate from infrastructure (no DB, no
HTTP). The pricing rules — *"2 days at the standard rate has no surcharge and
an 8% tax"*, *"a Saturday pickup adds a 10% surcharge"*, *"7+ days gets a 15%
discount, which overrides the weekend surcharge"* — are exactly this kind of
rule. Applying TDD to CRUD-shaped code (simple repository pass-throughs) would
add process overhead without added confidence, so those layers were instead
covered with tests written immediately alongside the implementation
(test-immediately, not test-first) and with one full integration test.

**The red→green→refactor cycle actually followed for this component:**

1. **Red.** `PricingContextTest` (`backend/src/test/java/.../pattern/strategy/PricingContextTest.java`)
   was written against a `PricingContext` class and three strategy classes that
   **did not yet exist**. The test suite failed to compile — the first "red".
2. **Green.** `PricingStrategy`, `StandardPricingStrategy`,
   `WeekendPricingStrategy`, `LongTermDiscountPricingStrategy` and
   `PricingContext` were implemented one at a time, re-running the relevant
   `@Nested` test group after each, until all assertions passed with the
   simplest logic that satisfied them (e.g. the weekend check was first written
   inline in each strategy).
3. **Refactor.** Once all three strategies were green, the duplicated
   "apply tax and round to 2 d.p." logic that had been copy-pasted into each
   `calculate()` method was pulled up into `AbstractPricingStrategy.buildResult()`.
   The test suite was re-run **unchanged** and still passed, which is exactly
   the guarantee TDD is meant to provide during a refactor.

The boundary cases in that same test class (a 1-day rental billed as one full
day, a 6-day rental *not* yet qualifying for the long-term discount, a
long-term discount overriding a weekend surcharge) were written as part of the
same red→green cycle, before the corresponding `if`/comparison logic was
finalised in `PricingContext.resolveStrategy()`.

## 4. Test levels & tools

| Level | Tool | What it proves |
|---|---|---|
| Unit | JUnit 5 + AssertJ | Pure logic in isolation (pricing math, `ReservationBuilder` validation) |
| Unit (with collaborators) | JUnit 5 + Mockito | Service-layer branching logic with repositories/publishers mocked out (`ReservationServiceImplTest`, `BillFactoryTest`) |
| Integration | Spring Boot Test (`@SpringBootTest`) + MockMvc + H2 in-memory DB | The real Spring context, the real Spring Security filter chain, and real JPA/Hibernate SQL generation, wired together |
| API (manual/exploratory) | Postman collection, curl (see `docs/SETUP.md` §6) | Contract-level verification against a **real** MySQL instance via XAMPP |
| Database | MySQL CLI against `database/schema.sql` | Triggers, stored procedure, views, and constraints behave as designed |

Automated tests run against **H2** (fast, no external service needed, safe to
run in CI — see `.github/workflows/ci.yml`); manual/API testing runs against
the **real MySQL** instance to validate the parts H2 cannot (the MySQL-specific
trigger/procedure/views), per the note in `docs/SETUP.md` §9.6.

## 5. Test data

- **Automated tests:** each test class seeds its own minimal, deterministic
  data in `@BeforeEach` (e.g. one category, one vehicle, one staff user) so
  tests are independent and repeatable in any order.
- **Manual/API testing:** `database/schema.sql` seeds 2 staff accounts, 5
  vehicle categories, 9 vehicles (including one `MAINTENANCE` vehicle to test
  the "unavailable vehicle" rule), and 3 customers — see `docs/SETUP.md` §2.4.
- **Boundary test data** is chosen deliberately at the edges of each business
  rule: exactly 1 day, exactly 6 vs. exactly 7 days (either side of the
  long-term-discount threshold), a Friday/Saturday/Sunday vs. a Tuesday pickup,
  and a same-day pickup/return with an invalid (earlier) return time.

## 6. Entry / exit criteria

**Entry:** the feature under test compiles and its dependencies (a running
MySQL for manual tests) are available per `docs/SETUP.md`.

**Exit:** `./mvnw test` reports zero failures and zero errors across all test
classes (see `testing/evidence/` for a captured passing run at
25/25 tests), and every row in `TEST_CASES.md` has a `PASS` status.

## 7. Test automation

All JUnit tests are runnable with a single command (`./mvnw test`, see
`docs/SETUP.md` §8) and are wired into GitHub Actions CI
(`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) so they run automatically on every push — see
`docs/GIT_WORKFLOW.md`.

## 8. Traceability

`TEST_CASES.md` includes an "Automated in" column mapping every test case back
to the exact test class/method (or Postman request) that proves it, and back
to the brief requirement or design decision it verifies.

## 9. Risks & mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| H2 test DB behaves subtly differently from MySQL (dialect quirks) | Encountered directly during development — H2 reserves `year` as a keyword, MySQL does not; the column was renamed to `manufacture_year` project-wide rather than suppressed, which is the more correct fix and improves portability generally |
| Trigger/procedure/view logic (MySQL-only) is invisible to the H2-based automated suite | Covered separately by the manual database-level test cases in §"Database Tests" of `TEST_CASES.md`, executed directly via the MySQL CLI |
| Time-sensitive tests (e.g. "pickup date in the future") becoming stale | Dates in integration tests are computed relative to `LocalDate.now()`, not hard-coded |
