# Sunrise Vehicle Rentals — Online Vehicle Reservation System

A full-stack Java coursework project for **CIS6003 Advanced Programming**
(Cardiff Metropolitan University / ICBT Campus), implementing a distributed,
three-tier vehicle reservation and billing system with a Spring Boot REST API,
a MySQL database (via XAMPP), and a static HTML/CSS/JS client.

## Project layout

```
VehicleReservationSystem/
├── backend/          Spring Boot 3 (Java 17) REST API — Maven project (use ./mvnw)
├── frontend/          Static HTML/CSS/JS client (Bootstrap 5, vendored locally)
├── database/          MySQL schema.sql (tables, triggers, procedure, views, seed data)
├── diagrams/          Use Case / Class / Sequence x3 / ER diagrams (PlantUML + PNG)
├── testing/            Test plan, test case matrix, Postman collection, test evidence

└── .github/workflows/   CI pipeline (build + test on every push)
```

## Quick start

```
1. Start MySQL (XAMPP) and import database/schema.sql
2. cd backend && ./mvnw.cmd spring-boot:run        (API on http://localhost:8081)
3. Serve frontend/ via XAMPP Apache (or any static server) on http://localhost/vehicle-reservation-client/
4. Log in with admin / admin123 or kirisha / Kirisha@123
```

Full details, including troubleshooting XAMPP-specific issues, are in
[`docs/SETUP.md`](docs/SETUP.md).

## What's implemented

Every functionality from the assignment brief (login, register a new
reservation, search/display reservation details, calculate & print a bill, a
help section, and a safe exit/logout) plus the Task B requirements: a
distributed REST API, five GoF design patterns, a three-tier architecture, and
a MySQL database with triggers/a stored procedure/views for advanced reporting.

See [`docs/ASSIGNMENT_REPORT.md`](docs/ASSIGNMENT_REPORT.md) for the full
write-up (design rationale, pattern justification, testing strategy, and
evaluation against the marking criteria), and
[`diagrams/README.md`](diagrams/README.md) for the documented assumptions
behind the design.
